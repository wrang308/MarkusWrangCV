<h2 > About me</h2>

<div>
	
<p>Hello! I'm Markus! I'm currently a student at Gothenburg university where I study software engineering and
	management. I learn how to program and develop application and programs for customers in this program. I like to develop software
	and like the process of making new stuff and fix problems. I always have a good feeling after being able to fix problems and that's
	why I think I like programming a lot, I can fix problems all day long.
	I also like to work with other people, I like to work in a team, while working in a team I get the opportunity to
	help each others and get help myself if I get stuck with a task.  During this program I've worked with people from different
	countries and cultures and I love it.
</p>
	<p>
	I don't do programming all the time even though I enjoy to work on my own project during my freetime. I enjoy to spend
	time with friends, play sports where it's good to be tall and games. I really like volleyball and play/train it
	weekly. I would play any sport as long as there is a ball involved.
	I also like to spend time in the nature and on good days I'll even bring my camera trying to get some good photos.
</p>
	<p>While working I always try to make it professional and I value quality over quantity. When I make something
	I want it to work properly. I'll make the best product I can and try to bring something that a customer really wants. </p>
